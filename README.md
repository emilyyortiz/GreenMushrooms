## Project Description
We created the simple game of Bingo on a 5 by 5 board with 99 balls, in java. There is the classic bingo game that completely relies on chance, and another "biased version." In the biased version, the player can influence what ball will be drawn next by choosing from the upper or lower half of the ball blower. This game is played soley by typing. 
## How to Launch:
- Cd into the root directory.
- Compile ```javac Woo.java```.
- Run ```java Woo```.
- Then, follow the prompts and press ```enter``` to draw the first ball. Type ```Blower``` when you want to check the balls left in the ball blower. Continue to follow the prompts.
